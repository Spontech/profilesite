			<blockquote>During her semester in the
			Grade 11 Photography course, she took advantage of every opportunity and challenge in order
			to become a better photographer, by asking questions, researching techniques, improving her
			skills in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Bridge. Her assignments were always done with the utmost
			of care, and the presentation of her work was fantastic

					Tanisha - you should be very proud of what you have contributed to CERIC over a relatively short time. It was impressive to see how you were able to hit the ground running and understand very quickly what our organization is all about. We are grateful for your help in advancing our many data and web projects over the summer. It's been wonderful to be able to get to know you a bit over this time. Your initiative, insights and work ethic have been obvious and most appreciated. I hope over your few months with us you've also been able to absorb some career development fundamentals that will serve you well in the next steps with your career.

					Tanisha is extremely diligent and professional in her work. She has been able to learn the required skills for teaching coding to young children fast and molded herself in to a capable and reliable teacher in a very short period of time. She is receptive to constructive feedback and is always looking for ways to improve herself. From a complete beginner, she has been able to establish herself as one of the key teachers for MindKraft in just a couple of months. I believe there is a long and successful professional career ahead of her because of her multitude of qualities. It has been a pleasure working with Tanisha and I wish her the best in her future endeavors.
